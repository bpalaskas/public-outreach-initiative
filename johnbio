Within the heart of our organization, there is a story of faith, resilience, and
kindness that inspires our work. Led by Jon Curtis, who both experienced
and overcame homelessness, our mission is driven by a deep desire to bring
hope and light to those facing similar challenges. With a true understanding
of these hardships, Jon’s experience instilled a strong conviction to make a
tangible difference in people’s lives.
